# inTouch Gecko Spa indigoPlugin

![](https://github.com/Ghawken/Indigo-GeckoSPA/blob/master/geckoSpa.indigoPlugin/Resources/icon.png?raw=true)

This is a Indigo plugin for all Gecko Spa Controllers. (intouch 2 Wifi controllers)

[https://geckointouch.com/](https://geckointouch.com)

It allows creation of a Spa master device, and all accessory devices (pumps, blowers, lights) and control, triggering based on these values.

It is made possible by the python3 Geckolib here: http://github.com/gazoodle

Steps:

1. Install indigoplugin Bundle
2. Create Indigo new Device - Gecko Spa Main Spa Device:
   1. Wait for Plugin to find and connect to your Spa.....
   2. Once connected - click edit devices and create Devices..
      ![](https://github.com/Ghawken/Indigo-GeckoSPA/blob/master/geckoSpa.indigoPlugin/Resources/MainDeviceEdit.png?raw=true)
      Plugin will create all Pumps/lights/Blowers/and Eco_mode switch in same Folder as Main Spa Device.

Control Spa items.. On/Off usual triggers

The Main Spa Device has a number, quite a number of states it reports.  Most are updated every 60 seconds or so.

There are a number of Raw States that the plugin reports - these are added to as received, some may be of use...

Actions:
A number of Actions are possible including Setting temperature and changing Water Care Modes..

Issues:
Only 1 Spa in total can be controlled with the approach I have taken.  Didn't think there probably wouldn't be too many households with x2 spas....
You can create more than one Main Spa Device - but will only connect to first spa found.
Device controls:  On / Off - at times there can be a refusal to action the command.  This means very occasionally your device won't turn on as expected. (ðŸ˜• )  The device state will quickly reflect the actual devices states and you will need to try again.  (I may be able to fine tune this further - but fairly infrequent-  this as time/versions go on..)
